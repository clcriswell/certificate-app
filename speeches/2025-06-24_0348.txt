Imagine, if you will, a scene from an ancient battle—warriors standing by the sea, the swell of their voices rising like a symphony of defiance. This symbolic battlefield might seem distant, yet it bears a profound relevance to our gathering today. We're not brandishing swords, but wielding our voices and influence in defense of our community’s values. And much like those warriors, we are emboldened by a promise—a victory that is not yet visible, but surely ours.

I must first extend my deepest gratitude to our friend Gary Anaian, a beacon of hope and resilience in our shared journey against AB 84. His steadfast leadership and unwavering commitment illuminate our path, enabling us to stand together in this crucial moment.

Now, why are we all gathered here on this day? Here’s the challenge we face: AB 84 threatens the very fabric of our economic freedoms and the principles we've long championed. It’s like a looming shadow over our Capitol, promising a storm of regulations that could curtail the vitality of our enterprises. This isn't just about policy—it's about the heartbeat of our community.

You might ask, "Why must we address this now, with such urgency?" My friends, the time is now because we stand at a crossroads. The debate over AB 84 isn't just about business; it's a struggle for fair opportunity, for the right to thrive without oppressive constraints. If we do not stand united today, who will speak for our vision tomorrow?

Picture, if you will, where we’re headed—a future undimmed by the specters of unnecessary legislation. Imagine a community where businesses flourish under the warm sun of true economic liberty. The mantra here is clear: “Our God wins, so now we sing.” Our actions must echo that truth, affirming our faith in justice yet unseen but thundering in our hearts.

So, what are we doing to shield our vision of freedom? First, we've mobilized a network of like-minded leaders across the state—our own warrior scholars—dedicated to enlightening our representatives. They are sharing stories and statistics from our very streets, pulling back the curtain on the real impact of AB 84.

Next, we’re amplifying our message through a strategic media campaign, one that echoes our values and rights, transforming whispers of dissent into a chorus of liberty heard in every chamber hall. Our team is ensuring that every voice, every business has a platform to be heard—because, my friends, this battle is won with shared resolve and unwavering courage.

Lastly, it's our grassroots initiatives—weekly forums much like this one—where we discuss, strategize, and fortify one another with information and inspiration. We know that to cultivate change, we must first cultivate understanding. This is our sea of glass mingled with fire, a platform of strength and reflection.

So, what’s next, you might wonder? Our next steps are pivotal. Let us carry this torch of hope and determination—they can legislate legislation, but they cannot legislate our resolve. Our God wins, so now we sing. It's time to ensure that this song becomes a resounding anthem within every heart and home.

In closing, let us remember that the battle isn't just fought in grand gestures but in every small act of hope and defiance. Stand firm, for in our unity, the spirit of perseverance is our greatest ally. “Together in courage, we declare victory ahead.”

Let's keep singing, let's keep standing strong. Thank you.
