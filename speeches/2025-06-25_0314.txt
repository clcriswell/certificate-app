Imagine the scent of freshly tilled earth and the sight of endless blue sky broken only by the silhouettes of oil rigs dotting our landscape. My grandfather used to take me out to these fields, the very fields that have sustained Kern generations with both pride and prosperity. I learned early on that beneath our feet lies not just oil, but opportunity. An opportunity to fuel our lives, our schools, our hospitals. I feel grateful for this community that values hard work and innovation, just like my grandfather did.

Here's where we stand. We know that our world is changing, and our way of life here in Kern must adapt with it. This is about more than fuel; it's about finding a balance between progression and preservation. And today, that's where our focus shifts—to safeguard our work and our home.

Now, picture a future where "efficiency leads us forward." Where Kern not only meets the standards but sets them. With this new permitting ordinance, we’re stepping into that future. It aims at not just compliance, but excellence. Excellence in how we produce energy responsibly while keeping our community strong.

We’re getting practical. Firstly, the ordinance is crafted to streamline and elevate environmental impact reviews (EIR). This makes sure what we do aligns with the highest quality care for our land and air. Secondly, there are innovations in technology—technologies that cut emissions without cutting jobs. Lastly, strict monitoring systems will keep us accountable, safeguarding not only our environment but our economy.

So what's next for us? It's time for everyone in this room—and beyond—to embrace this change, to lend your voices and your hands to this venture. Together, we have the chance to lead Kern County, to be the makers, not just the takers.

Let's grab this opportunity with both hands. Because efficiency leads us forward, and together, we can power a future that honors our past while blazing a trail toward a sustainable tomorrow.
