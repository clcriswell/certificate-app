A couple of mornings ago, I walked through Poso Creek with my granddaughter. We shuffled through crunchy leaves, picking up tiny acorns, and she asked me why they stay on top of the ground when the wind is so strong. I smiled and said it's because they're rooted in the soil — like us, like our community. It made me think about our shared commitment right here in Kern County.

Let me just start by saying how deeply grateful I am for each and every one of you who has come out tonight. You’re the backbone of this place we all call home, bringing your hands, hearts, and voices to matters that affect us all.

Now, here's the challenge we face: As a community, we’re dealing with a lot of external perceptions about the oil and gas industry. Folks may criticize, but they don’t always know the full story. Why now? Because Kern County has set benchmarks in oil and gas production that are the best in the state, and yet we're still importing from sources that don't meet those same high standards. It's time we took a stand for what we’ve accomplished.

Picture this: A future where our children learn about energy and industry from a community leading the way in responsibility and innovation. Our mantra here? "Pride in our practices." We want to be known not just for what we produce, but how we produce it — with integrity, with care for the earth, and with a commitment to the people who live here.

So what are we doing about it? First, we're advocating for policies that highlight our environmental protections that are second to none. Next, we're investing in cleaner technologies that not only preserve jobs but create new ones. And finally, we're standing shoulder to shoulder with each of you, collaborating with state leaders to ensure our standards become the benchmark.

I invite all of you to join this journey. Share your stories, vote for leaders who support our industry, and let’s ensure that our practices become the model for others. 

Because as our acorns stay grounded, together we will stay rooted in progress. Let's take pride in our practices, and show the world what Kern County stands for.

Thank you.
