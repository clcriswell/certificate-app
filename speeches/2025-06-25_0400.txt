Chairwoman Perez and Board,

Stan Ellis, 32nd District Assemblyman.

I'm here to speak in support of the EIR, and to thank Lorelei Oviatt for her leadership and hard work in getting the ordinance to where it is today.

Kern county is a place where hard work isn’t just a choice, it’s a way of life. Where true strength is rooted in community and progress, ideals that guide me every day. 

Our community stands at a crucial turning point. The stakes? Our wellbeing, our economy, and our shared future. We face the challenge of balancing energy needs with a clean, sustainable environment. This is not something vague or future-bound; the impacts are immediate, affecting our air, water, and health.

We aim for: Cleaner Energy, Stronger Community. This isn’t just a dream. It’s a vision of Kern County as a leader in safe, responsible energy production that ensures a brighter tomorrow for our children and their children.

This ordinance shows we’re taking solid steps. We’re implementing rigorous emission control technologies. It’s about maintaining the integrity of our resources while keeping our air clean. We’re also investing in training programs, equipping our workforce with skills for evolving industries without leaving anyone behind.

Let me be clear: it’s not enough to sit back and watch. We need to act, all of us, together. Show up, ask questions, hold us accountable. Because it’s our hands, every single pair, that will bring this vision to life. 

Now remember, our future walks hand in hand with our convictions. Cleaner Energy, Stronger Community. It's more than a mantra—it's our anthem.

So let’s rise, with purpose, and change our story for the better. Together, let’s drive Kern County toward a resilient, invigorated tomorrow. That's how we succeed: Our unity is our power, let's use it!
