Ladies and gentlemen,

Thank you all for being here today. It's always inspiring to see so many dedicated individuals committed to understanding the path we're traveling as a community, especially during times of change. I want to take a moment to recognize Les Clark for his unwavering dedication and leadership—thank you, Les, for your hard work and steadfast support.

Today, we're gathered to discuss the recent legislative developments in California concerning the oil industry. I understand the gravity of these changes for all of us, especially those working tirelessly in the field. Each of you plays an integral role in our community, and it’s crucial that we face these challenges head-on, together.

Let's begin with a clear overview of the legislation. Recently, California introduced measures aimed at reducing carbon emissions, which impacts how we operate. These laws push for technological advances, demanding a shift towards cleaner, more renewable energy solutions. At first glance, this may seem daunting, even threatening to our current way of life. However, I assure you, within these challenges lies a wealth of opportunity.

In times of change, it’s easy to focus on what we stand to lose. But I urge us all to look at what we can gain. With innovation and hard work, we can transform our industry into one that not only supports the environment but also provides stability and growth in our jobs. The potential for retraining and new skill acquisition is vast. I encourage each of you to embrace these opportunities for advancement. Together, we can build an industry that is resilient and future-proof.

Now, I know that making these shifts requires more than words—it requires action. This is where our community's spirit of collaboration shines. Our local government is committed to supporting new training programs and providing resources to help us adapt to these changes. We need to engage, to voice our needs, and to make sure that our community has the skills and tools to lead in this new direction.

I stand here, not just as a speaker, but as someone who is deeply invested in the success of every person here. We must harness our collective strengths to innovate, transform, and thrive amid these legislative shifts. By embracing this journey together, we can ensure that our industry continues to be the backbone of our community, offering jobs and prosperity for generations to come.

To conclude, let's focus on hope. Hope is not just a distant dream—it's an action plan. It's the belief that we can chart a better course for ourselves, our families, and our community. Let us walk forward, hand in hand, ready to seize the opportunities ahead.

Thank you once again for being here and for your commitment to our community. Together, we will navigate these changes and emerge stronger than ever.

Thank you.
