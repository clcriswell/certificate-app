Folks, good evening.

As I walked here tonight, I couldn’t help but remember the first time I drove through the oil fields of our county with my grandfather. He used to point out the rigs and whisper, “These are not just machines, they’re lifelines.” He taught me that what we build here isn’t just for profit—it’s the pulse of Kern County, the livelihood for many, and the backbone of families. Thank you all for being part of this community, for bringing those values to life every day.

We’re here because there’s a lot at stake. I won’t sugarcoat it—the health of our community and economy depend on decisions made right now. The challenge in front of us is clear: ensuring that our local oil and gas production remains the gold standard in safety and sustainability, especially when compared to where some of our imports originate. Why now? Because every well we protect strengthens our community and safeguards our future.

Now imagine a future where Kern County isn’t just a leader in oil production, but the model that others strive to replicate—a beacon of progress and responsibility. Our mantra tonight? “Excellence in Energy Security.” It’s not just about maintaining standards, but setting new ones that align with our values.

What are we doing to get there? Let’s talk specifics. We've implemented advanced monitoring technologies that reduce emissions and preserve air quality—setting precedents that the whole state should follow. Next, we’re investing in local talent and training programs so our workforce is not only skilled but the best in the industry. Finally, the ordinance we’re discussing tonight reinforces our commitment to environmental stewardship. It’s not just words on paper; it’s a blueprint for action.

So what’s next? We need each of you to lend your voice, your support, your energy. Together, we can ensure Kern County remains a place where energy empowers us, not just economically, but as a community rooted in innovation and integrity.

Let’s continue building on the promise of our shared tomorrow.

Thank you. Let's champion excellence in energy security.
