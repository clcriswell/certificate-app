Let me take you back to a clear morning I spent at a family-run farm right on the outskirts of our beloved Kern County. As the sun broke over the rows of almond trees, I was reminded of the beauty and resilience of our land — and, more importantly, the people who tend to it with tireless devotion. It’s not just a landscape; it’s our home, our livelihood. 

Today, I want to express deep gratitude to all of you who roll up your sleeves every day to nurture this community. Your dedication does not go unnoticed.

Here's the challenge we face together: Despite having the highest environmental standards in oil and gas production, our community is coming under pressure from policies that threaten our local industry’s health. We import when what we produce here is better, cleaner, and safer for our families.

This is why today’s moment matters. We’re at a crossroads, where the need to champion local production doesn’t just spark jobs but safeguards the environment — right here at home. We have an opportunity to model a future where energy independence pairs with environmental stewardship. "Kern Leads with Integrity."

Let’s take stock of what's already in motion. First, our production processes lead the state in reducing emissions and utilizing technology to minimize environmental impact. Secondly, our local ordinance ensures that every drop of energy extracted is done with accountability and transparency. Lastly, we're working with state leaders to highlight these standards, pushing for policies that prioritize what’s produced here over less-regulated imports from afar.

So now, what’s next? Let’s rally around our ordinance that upholds these standards. Together, let’s be the voice that doesn’t just echo concerns but offers solutions — our solutions. 

"Kern Leads with Integrity" is not just our mantra, it’s our promise. Let’s renew it today with purpose and pride.

In the spirit of that sunrise over the almond groves, let us rise to this challenge and ensure our future is powered by the values we hold dear. Let's keep what’s best for our land, and our people, at the forefront. Together, we safeguard our treasury.
