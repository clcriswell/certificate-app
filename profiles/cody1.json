    "From Judgment to Joy: Singing the Victors\u2019 Song at the Sea of Glass\n\nPlease open to Revelation 15\n\nRevelation 15:1-4 NKJV\nThen I saw another sign in heaven, great and marvelous: seven angels having the seven last plagues, for in them the wrath of God is complete. [2] And I saw something like a sea of glass mingled with fire, and those who have the victory over the beast, over his image and over his mark and over the number of his name, standing on the sea of glass, having harps of God. [3] They sing the song of Moses, the servant of God, and the song of the Lamb, saying: \"Great and marvelous are Your works, Lord God Almighty! Just and true are Your ways, O King of the saints! [4] Who shall not fear You, O Lord, and glorify Your name? For You alone are holy. For all nations shall come and worship before You, For Your judgments have been manifested.\"\n\nIn these verses, John describes a powerful image: \n\"a sea of glass mingled with fire,\" and God\u2019s people standing by that fiery sea, singing triumphantly. \nIt\u2019s a vision of judgment and peace, fire and calm, beautifully intertwined. \nThose standing there aren't just spectators; they\u2019re survivors who overcame evil. \nTheir song\u2014the Song of Moses and the Song of the Lamb\u2014is a chorus celebrating victory and redemption.\n\nDeuteronomy 32 records the song of moses:\n\nDeuteronomy 32:3-4 NKJV\nFor I proclaim the name of the LORD: Ascribe greatness to our God. [4] He is the Rock, His work is perfect; For all His ways are justice, A God of truth and without injustice; Righteous and upright is He.\n\nDeuteronomy 32:39 NKJV\n'Now see that I, even I, am He, And there is no God besides Me; I kill and I make alive; I wound and I heal; Nor is there any who can deliver from My hand.\n\nDeuteronomy 32:43 NKJV\n\"Rejoice, O Gentiles, with His people; For He will avenge the blood of His servants, And render vengeance to His adversaries; He will provide atonement for His land and His people.\"\n\n\nLet me share why this matters to us. \nWhen John penned Revelation, Christians were under intense persecution from Rome. \nTheir world was literally burning.\n Jerusalem had fallen catastrophically, the Temple destroyed. \nThe historian Josephus tells chilling stories of desperation: \nfamine so severe people ate leather to survive. \nEven darker, a mother driven by hunger cooking her child. \nIt\u2019s almost too much to comprehend.\n\nThe early church historian Eusebius later saw Jerusalem's destruction clearly as divine judgment for rejecting Jesus. \nYet, even amidst that terror, God protected His own. \nBefore Jerusalem fell, Christians were warned to flee to safety in a town called Pella. \nJudgment fell, but God\u2019s faithful were saved. \nCan you feel the weight of that? \nJudgment may come, but grace is waiting for those who listen.\n\nThis is the reality John\u2019s audience knew firsthand\u2014brutal judgment, but also miraculous deliverance. \nMany asked, \n\"Lord, where is justice? \nAre we really on the winning side?\" \nRevelation 15 provides the clear, confident answer: \nGod\u2019s judgment might be delayed, but it will never be denied.\n Evil will fall. \nFaithfulness will stand.\n\nPicture again John\u2019s vision: \nSeven angels holding the last plagues of God\u2019s wrath. It reminds us of Moses and Pharaoh.\nJust as Egypt faced ten plagues to free God's people, now seven final plagues are coming to fully and finally defeat evil. \nScripture calls it \u201cgreat and marvelous\u201d\u2014a decisive moment when divine patience runs out. \nJustice will be served, completely.\n\nThen the vision shifts to that sea of glass, now mingled with fire\u2014heaven\u2019s purity touched by the flames of judgment. \nIt\u2019s an impossible blend, yet in God\u2019s realm, judgment and mercy perfectly coexist. \nAnd standing safely on this fiery sea are those who faced the world\u2019s worst evils\u2014the beast, its image, its oppressive power\u2014and didn\u2019t bow. \nThese victors were everyday heroes, believers who refused to declare \"Caesar is Lord,\" even under threat of death. \nJohn sees them alive and triumphant, safe on God\u2019s shore, looking back at defeated evil.\n\nDo you sense the hope there? \nThe most frightening forces\u2014the Roman Empire, oppressive rulers, death itself\u2014will be utterly defeated, and God's people will stand fearlessly, with hearts full of song.\n\nNotice carefully what they\u2019re doing. \nThey aren\u2019t celebrating themselves. \nNo victory laps here. \nThey are singing. \nSinging the song of Moses and the Lamb. \nMoses\u2019 song celebrated liberation from Egypt; \nnow it blends seamlessly with the Lamb\u2019s song celebrating our greater deliverance from sin through the cross and resurrection. \nThe Exodus foreshadowed a greater rescue\u2014the Passover pointed toward Christ\u2019s sacrifice.\n\nListen to their song\u2019s powerful words:\n\"Great and marvelous are Your works, Lord God Almighty! Just and true are Your ways, O King of the saints! Who shall not fear You, O Lord, and glorify Your name? For You alone are holy. All nations shall come and worship before You, for Your judgments have been manifested.\"\n\nIt\u2019s not a sad song; it\u2019s triumphant. \nThey're declaring, \u201cLord, You proved Yourself faithful. Every nation will see Your justice.\u201d \nThis song vindicates God's character. \nMaybe today, you\u2019ve wondered why injustice seems unchecked, why good people suffer. \nThis song promises that a day is coming when the truth about God\u2019s fairness will be undeniable. \nAll nations\u2014even former skeptics\u2014will bow in worship.\n\nThis victory song is our song. \nThe core truth of this vision is simple: \"God\u2019s victory is declared in our Worship.\" \nWe don't sing because life is easy; \nWe sing because we trust His victory, even when life is hard.\nLet this sink in. \nPicture that fiery sea, the victorious crowd, our holy God receiving His due worship. \nImagine yourself there\u2014because if you belong to Jesus, that is indeed your destination.\n\nThis vision calls us to persevere and worship boldly. \nLet it strengthen your heart and lift your voice today. \nBecause one day soon, we\u2019ll all join in heaven\u2019s anthem.\n\"God\u2019s victory is declared in our Worship.\"\n\n\nGod\u2019s Purpose in Judgement\n\nRevelation 15 makes something clear: \nGod\u2019s judgment is real, and it's good. \nJohn saw \"seven angels having the seven last plagues, for in them the wrath of God is complete\" (Rev 15:1). \nThat phrase stops us cold\u2014the wrath of God is complete. \nFinished. \nFilled up. \nIt reminds us that evil and injustice won\u2019t last forever. \nI know judgment isn\u2019t a comfortable topic; \nit\u2019s tough to hear. \nBut think about this: \nwould we truly love a God who stayed indifferent toward cruelty? \nCould we worship a God who shrugs at Auschwitz, who turns away from child abuse or human trafficking?\nNo, we couldn\u2019t. \n\nGod's justice means evil has an expiration date. \nRevelation 15 shows a moment when God finally says, \"Enough. No more.\" \nThose bowls of wrath in the next chapter aren't random punishment\u2014they\u2019re purposeful cleansing, setting things right once and for all.\n\nWhat does this mean practically? \n\nIt means we can trust God\u2019s justice instead of losing hope or taking revenge ourselves. \n\nRomans 12:19 NKJV\nBeloved, do not avenge yourselves, but rather give place to wrath; for it is written, \"Vengeance is Mine, I will repay,\" says the Lord.\n\nWe can overcome evil with good because we trust God will ultimately overcome evil Himself.\n\nThe early church needed this reminder. \nThey saw Rome\u2019s brutality firsthand. \nThey watched Israel compromise themselves and partner with Rome in the persecution of the Church.\nTo the human eye, it seemed meaningless, but Jesus predicted that tragedy decades earlier:\n\nLuke 19:41-44 NKJV\nNow as He drew near, He saw the city and wept over it, [42] saying, \"If you had known, even you, especially in this your day, the things that make for your peace! But now they are hidden from your eyes. [43] For days will come upon you when your enemies will build an embankment around you, surround you and close you in on every side, [44] and level you, and your children within you, to the ground; and they will not leave in you one stone upon another, because you did not know the time of your visitation.\"\n\nGod patiently delayed judgment, calling His people to repentance. \nJosephus, the historian, recorded unusual signs\u2014a sword-shaped star over Jerusalem, voices in the temple crying out warnings. \nYet they ignored these signs, and judgment came.\n\n\nBut notice this: \nWhen judgment fell, the faithful had already been safely led out.\n\nWe see this pattern again and again. \nJudgment for one group brings redemption for another. \nThink of Pharaoh at the Red Sea: \nThe waters that crushed Pharaoh\u2019s army were the very same waters that stood aside so God\u2019s people could walk free. \nJudgment and redemption go hand in hand, two sides of God\u2019s perfect action in the world.\n\nHere\u2019s our invitation today, and it comes in two parts: \n\nA warning and a comfort.\n\nFirst, the warning:\n\n Let\u2019s not align ourselves with anything God must judge. \nPride, bitterness, dishonesty\u2014whatever Pharaoh-like spirit might linger in our hearts, let's deal with it now. \nGod\u2019s mercy holds back destruction, but only for so long. \nOne Puritan writer put it vividly: \u201cThe sword of God\u2019s justice may sleep, but it never rusts.\u201d \nEventually, unrepentant evil must face the music.\n\nBut second, here\u2019s the comfort: \n\nIf you belong to the Lamb, you live under mercy, not wrath. \nGod\u2019s judgment isn\u2019t something to fear; it\u2019s something to respect, yes\u2014but also to praise Him for. \nBecause judgment means your suffering will be vindicated and every enemy\u2014sin, Satan, even death itself\u2014will be overcome. \nHow many times have we cried tears over injustice\u2014a loved one lost to reckless tragedy, a faithful person mistreated? \nWe might not see justice fully on this side of eternity, but Revelation 15 promises no one ultimately escapes accountability. \nEvery Hitler, every oppressor, every unrepentant rebel faces true justice. \nAnd we will say \u201cHallelujah!\u201d when God\u2019s righteousness is fully revealed.\n\nWe can see this on display in the world right now.\n\nYesterday, new broke on about the US carrrying out an attack on Iran\u2019s Nuclear facility. There was fire.\n\nSome could view this as Judgement. \nIs that to say that those executing the attack are righteous.\nNo, not necessarily. The natural forces executing judgment are not indicators of alignment with Christ. \nMany times, God used secular nations to carry out his judgement against evil nations.\n\nHere\u2019s the reality, Iran is one of the leading nations that persecute Christians. \n\nIn 2024, there was a sixfold increase of Christians imprisoned and sentenced in Iran.\nIran accounts for 15% of all religious freedom prisoner worldwide.\nIran executed over 900 civilians in 2024 alone, many on charges directly related to religious beliefs or practices.\nIran scored a 0 on a scale of 0-4 for religious freedom.\nChristinas must worship in secrecy in Iran.\n90% of the documented cases of persecution involved converts from Islam\nConversion from Islam and evangelism are punishable by imprisonment or even death under Iran\u2019s penal code.\n\nThough the attack doesn\u2019t speak to either US or Israel always being righteous, it does show us:\n\nGod will not allow his church to suffer forever. He will bring judgment against her oppressors and justice for the oppressed.\n\n\nDictators fall, captives are freed, reminding us that evil won\u2019t have the last word. God will.\n\nRather than fear, this truth leads us to worship. \nRevelation\u2019s victors sing: \u201cJust and true are Your ways\u2026 Your judgments have been manifested\u201d (Rev 15:3-4). \nThey rejoice because God refuses to forever tolerate cruelty or unbelief.\n\nAre we living in light of this promise? \n\nIt should make us humble, knowing without Christ, we'd face judgment too. \nIt should make us hopeful, trusting every sacrifice, every moment of integrity, will be worth it when God balances the scales. \nInstead of vengeance, we can forgive. \nInstead of despair over daily news, we can quietly pray, \u201cLord, I trust You\u2019ll sort this out. Maranatha\u2014come, Lord, and do justice.\u201d\n\nEarly Christians faced persecution without bitterness, praying even for their persecutors, trusting fully in God's justice. \nTradition tells us Polycarp worshipped even as flames took his life. \nThat\u2019s what happens when we trust God\u2019s ultimate control: \njudgment and salvation intertwined. \nWe can sing through the fire because we know the fire won\u2019t have the final say.\n\nGod's judgment clears the way for His new creation.\n\nTake heart: evil doesn\u2019t win\u2014God will, God will.\n\nVictory Through the Lamb \n\nThis passage speaks to how we win\u2014not by force, not by compromise, but by holding fast to the Lamb of God.\n\nJohn describes a crowd in Revelation who \u201chave the victory over the beast\u201d (Rev. 15:2). \nThese weren\u2019t warriors with swords or politicians with power. \nThey were ordinary believers\u2014some who paid with their lives. \n\nHow did they conquer? \n\nRevelation 12:11 NKJV\nAnd they overcame him by the blood of the Lamb and by the word of their testimony, and they did not love their lives to the death.\n\nTheir weapon wasn\u2019t strength; it was faithfulness.\n\nHere\u2019s the challenge: \n\nWhen we hear \u201cvictory,\u201d we picture winning a fight, coming out on top. \nBut in God\u2019s kingdom, victory often looks like surrender. \nJesus conquered sin by dying on the cross. \nFriday seemed like defeat\u2014Sunday proved it was triumph. \nThe world may call us weak when we refuse to cut corners, when we choose integrity over influence, when we love instead of lash out. \nBut God sees an overcomer. \nEvery time you say, \u201cNo, I won\u2019t bend on what Jesus says is right,\u201d you\u2019re defeating the beast.\n\nJohn\u2019s vision shows the saints standing on a sea of glass, holding harps (Rev. 15:2). \nHarps, not swords. \nTheir battle was fought with worship, their victory won through patient faith. \nOne day, the contrast will be undeniable. \nThe beast\u2019s followers may laugh now, but when the dust settles, only the faithful remain, singing. \n\nPsalm 30:5 NKJV\nFor His anger is but for a moment, His favor is for life; Weeping may endure for a night, But joy comes in the morning.\n\nThe morning after the long night belongs to God\u2019s people.\n\nSo what does victory look like for us? \n\nIt looks like perseverance. \nLike holding onto Jesus tighter than we cling to comfort, reputation, or even safety. \nThat\u2019s not easy\u2014but grace meets us there. \nRevelation\u2019s letters to the churches repeat this promise: \u201cTo him who overcomes\u2026\u201d (Rev. 2-3). \nThe reward isn\u2019t for the strong-armed, but for the steadfast.\n\nLet\u2019s get practical. \n\nYou may not face lions, but maybe a workplace where honesty costs you a promotion. \nMaybe our kids face a social beast\u2014pressure to trade their faith for acceptance. \nMaybe you\u2019ve been called \u201ctoo religious\u201d for doing the right thing. \nThese are today\u2019s battlefields. \n\nHow do we overcome? \n\nBy refusing to let the world mold us.\nBy loving when hate is loud. \nBy singing before the breakthrough comes.\n\nPaul and Silas sang in prison at midnight.\n\nActs 16:25 NKJV\nBut at midnight Paul and Silas were praying and singing hymns to God, and the prisoners were listening to them.\n\nTheir praise shook the walls. Sometimes your song in the dark is what breaks chains\u2014if not around you, within you. \n\nAnd history shows us: \n\nEarly Christians didn\u2019t overthrow Rome with revolt; \nthey outlasted it with relentless love. \nThe same Lamb who conquered death is still conquering\u2014through ordinary people like us.\n\nSo here\u2019s my question: \n\nWhat beast is roaring at you? \n\nFear? \nTemptation? \nPressure to stay silent? \n\nRemember, the mark of the beast was about allegiance\u2014whose way will you follow? \n\nEvery \u201cno\u201d to compromise is a \u201cyes\u201d to Christ. Every act of integrity, every stand taken in love, echoes in eternity.\n\nYou might feel weary, outnumbered.\n\n But listen: \n\nGod calls you overcomer now, not just later. \n\n\u201cThis is the victory that has overcome the world\u2014our faith\u201d \n\n1 John 5:4 NKJV\nFor whatever is born of God overcomes the world. And this is the victory that has overcome the world-our faith.\n\n Not our strength\u2014our trust in Jesus. So keep the faith. Keep the song. Fight with worship, with kindness, with quiet obedience. \n\nOne day, Jesus will point to moments you thought were small and say, \u201cLook how they overcame.\u201d\n\nHere\u2019s the call: \n\nPersevere and praise. \nLive differently. \nSing anyway. \n\nThe sea of glass is before God\u2019s throne\u2014meaning He\u2019s with you in the battle. You fight armored in His strength, covered by the Lamb\u2019s blood. So you can\u2019t lose in the long run.\n\n\nKeep the faith. The victory\u2019s already won.\n\nWorship is Our Weapon and Our Destiny\n\nThis passage shows that worship is both our weapon and our destiny.\n\nSometimes, we think worship is something that comes after God does something great\u2014like a victory celebration. \n\nBut Revelation 15 paints a different picture. The heart of the vision isn\u2019t plagues or even parted seas\u2014it\u2019s the song itself. \n\n Revelation 15:3 NKJV\nThey sing the song of Moses, the servant of God, and the song of the Lamb, saying: \"Great and marvelous are Your works, Lord God Almighty! Just and true are Your ways, O King of the saints!\n\nWorship isn't just gratitude after victory\u2014it's a powerful act that proclaims who God is even before the battle ends.\n\nThink about the Israelites by the Red Sea. \n\nTheir song wasn\u2019t just a thank-you note\nIt was a bold announcement: Yahweh alone is mighty. \n\nExodus 15 tells us clearly\u2014when they sang, their enemies trembled and their own hearts filled with courage.\n Worship sends a message to everyone around us, even to spiritual darkness, declaring clearly who we trust. \nHistory tells us the early church sang hymns boldly, even under threat. It baffled outsiders\u2014how could these people sing so joyfully amid persecution?\n\nI know this to be true. \n\nI\u2019ve got a lot going on recently with my new position. \nTrying to manage not only the Church, but family and work with high demands.\nEverything is important, everything demands attention.\nI let someone down everyday. \nThere\u2019s things that needed to be done each day that don\u2019t get done, even after I spend 12 hours every day skipping lunch and working every second of that day. \nI have big shoulders and I can carry that, most days.\nBut there are days it\u2019s too much.\nI\u2019ve had those more frequently in this season.\n\nBut, it\u2019s nothing that worship cannot over come.\n\nStopping to worship before picking up Stan\u2026 A day that began in chaos ended with awe.\n\nIsaiah 61 calls it trading our heaviness for a garment of praise. \n\nIsaiah 61:10-11 NKJV\nI will greatly rejoice in the LORD, My soul shall be joyful in my God; For He has clothed me with the garments of salvation, He has covered me with the robe of righteousness, As a bridegroom decks himself with ornaments, And as a bride adorns herself with her jewels. [11] For as the earth brings forth its bud, As the garden causes the things that are sown in it to spring forth, So the Lord GOD will cause righteousness and praise to spring forth before all the nations.\n\nMany of you know exactly what I mean:\nyou've sung through sorrow, \nat hospitals or gravesides, \ndiscovering comfort in God's presence. \nThat\u2019s victory. \nThat\u2019s our weapon.\n\nSo what's next? \n\nMake worship part of daily life. Not necessarily singing everywhere, though a hymn during a tough day never hurts. \nBut intentionally keeping God's goodness and greatness in your heart. \n\nRevelation\u2019s song gives us a model:\n\nPraise His works (what He\u2019s done), \nPraise His ways (always right, even when mysterious), \nPraise His holiness (pure, unmatched), \nand Praise His righteous action (justice revealed clearly to the world). \n\nRemember the exodus moments in your life\u2014times God led you safely through. Praise Him for those moments.\nBut there's another side to worship:\n\nour witness\n\nRevelation 15 says, \u201cAll nations shall come and worship before You\u201d \n\nIsaiah 61:10-11 NKJV\nI will greatly rejoice in the LORD, My soul shall be joyful in my God; For He has clothed me with the garments of salvation, He has covered me with the robe of righteousness, As a bridegroom decks himself with ornaments, And as a bride adorns herself with her jewels. [11] For as the earth brings forth its bud, As the garden causes the things that are sown in it to spring forth, So the Lord GOD will cause righteousness and praise to spring forth before all the nations.\n\nThat's not just future prophecy; it's our call now. Every time we share Christ\u2019s love, speak truth with kindness, or show compassion, we invite people to join heaven\u2019s choir. \n\nThere's always room for another voice.\n\n\nHere in America, we can sing freely. \nLet's never take that for granted or sing half-heartedly. \nLet's sing like Moses' people by the sea, like believers who've known cost and persecution. \nLet's fill our homes with songs that anchor our families' faith.\n\n\nImagine someday your child facing trials, \nsuddenly recalling how you quietly sang \u201cIt is Well with My Soul\u201d in the kitchen. \nThat memory becomes courage for their battles. \nThat's the legacy worth leaving.\n\n\nWorship draws a line: \n\nWho will we serve? \n\nRevelation asks, \"Who shall not fear You and glorify Your name?\" Ultimately, every knee bows \n\nPhilippians 2:10-11 NKJV\nthat at the name of Jesus every knee should bow, of those in heaven, and of those on earth, and of those under the earth, [11] and that every tongue should confess that Jesus Christ is Lord, to the glory of God the Father.\n\nWe choose now to sing joyfully, willingly, rather than later by compulsion.\nThe drama of redemption is a musical, and God has given each of us a part. \nSo here's our action step: \n\nWorship daily, in word, song, and deed. \nTurn worries into praise, teach our families faith-songs, and let daily life echo with worship. \n\nRomans 12:1 NKJV\nI beseech you therefore, brethren, by the mercies of God, that you present your bodies a living sacrifice, holy, acceptable to God, which is your reasonable service.\n\noffer your life as worship\u2014treating others well, stewarding money, speaking kindly at home.\n\n\nLet\u2019s be that \"odd\" community joyfully praising God amidst a cynical world\u2014not blind optimism, but deep biblical hope. We know how the story ends. Our God wins, so we sing.\nLet\u2019s start now. Our song today prepares us for eternity, declaring God\u2019s glory and spreading hope.\nLet your life sing loud and clear: Our God wins and so we sing!\n\nSummary and Conclusion \n\nWe\u2019ve walked through Revelation 15:1\u20134 together\u2014standing with John in the throne room, watching the angels prepare for judgment, hearing the song of the victors rise over the fire and glass. \n\nIt\u2019s a vision of two things at once:\n\nGod\u2019s justice will come\nHis people will rejoice\n\nSo what do we do with that? How does this change the way we face Monday morning?  \n\nLet me put it simply: **Our God wins, so now we sing.** \nThat\u2019s the heartbeat of this passage.  \n\nRight now, evil often looks strong, and faithfulness can feel small. But Revelation shouts the truth\u2014God\u2019s justice *will* roll down, and His people *will* stand victorious.  \n\nSo we live today with endurance, worship, and invitation.\n\n3 Takeaways: \n\nStay faithful\n\nWhen the weight of the world makes you want to quit, remember the sea of glass and fire. \nEvery trial faced with Christ is temporary. \nEvery sacrifice for Him is seen. \nThe early Christians outlasted Rome\u2019s persecution. \nThe Reformers outlived the darkness. \nAnd if you\u2019re in the thick of it now, hold fast. \nYour faithfulness matters.\n As Paul said, *\"Be steadfast, immovable, always abounding in the work of the Lord\"* \n\n1 Corinthians 15:58 NKJV\nTherefore, my beloved brethren, be steadfast, immovable, always abounding in the work of the Lord, knowing that your labor is not in vain in the Lord.\n\nLive worshipfully.\n\nDon\u2019t wait for the battle to end to sing\u2014sing *now*. \nWorship is your birthright and your battery. \nThe song in Revelation 15 is stitched together from Psalms and Exodus, a reminder that God\u2019s people have always praised Him in the fire.\nSo let\u2019s align our lives with His holiness.\nIf there\u2019s an area where you\u2019re cutting corners, set it right. \nThat\u2019s worship too.  \n\nInvite others. \n\nThe song says *\"all nations will come and worship\"*\u2014so let\u2019s be part of that. \nShare your story this week. \nServe your neighbor. \nEvery act of love is a note in heaven\u2019s chorus. \nAnd keep the hope alive: Judgment isn\u2019t doom\u2014it\u2019s the road to redemption. \nThe time is *now* to sing and serve.  \n\nHere\u2019s a picture for you: \n\nImagine driving west at sunset, cresting a hill, and seeing the ocean stretched out, the sky on fire, the water dancing with light. Now imagine hearing a thousand voices singing, *\"Great and marvelous are Your works, Lord God Almighty!\"* That\u2019s where we\u2019re headed. \nThe trials? Temporary. \nThe song? Eternal.  \n\nSo this week, practice being a person of the victory song. \nWhen bad news comes, pause and say, *\"Lord, You are good.\"*\nWhen you meet someone despairing, point them to the God who rescues. \nWe don\u2019t live in fear\u2014the future belongs to our Father.  \n\nChurch, the curtain *will* fall on this age. But until then, we\u2019ve got a song to sing and a mission to fulfill. Stand firm. Lift your voice. Live like you believe it.  \n\nStand firm, sing loud\u2014the battle is won, and our God reigns.\n\nAmen."
